# An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, 
# and the day is called a leap day. It corrects the calendar for the fact that 
# our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.

# In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:

# The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
# The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
# The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
# This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, 
# while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years. Source

# Task

# Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, 
# otherwise return False.

# Note that the code stub provided reads from STDIN and passes arguments to the is_leap function. 
# It is only necessary to complete the is_leap function.
